# Autogram
[ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡° SlovenskÃ¡ verzia](README-SK.md)

Autogram is a multi-platform (Windows, MacOS, Linux) desktop JavaFX application for signing and verifying documents in accordance with the European eIDAS regulation. Users can sign files directly or easily integrate the application into their own (web) information system using HTTP API. Signing can also be initiated from the command line, which is suitable for batch signing large numbers of files at once.

**Installation packages for Windows, MacOS, and Linux are available in the [Releases](https://github.com/slovensko-digital/autogram/releases) section.** If you want to use Autogram on existing Slovak government websites, you will need to install a [browser extension](https://github.com/slovensko-digital/autogram-extension#readme) as well.

## Integration

Swagger documentation for the HTTP API is [available on GitHub](https://generator3.swagger.io/index.html?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slovensko-digital/autogram/main/src/main/resources/digital/slovensko/autogram/server/server.yml) or after starting the application at http://localhost:37200/docs.

You can trigger the application to run directly from a web browser by opening an address with the special protocol `autogram://`. For example, via `autogram://go`.

## Console Mode

Autogram can also be run from the command line (CLI mode). Detailed information about the switches is described in the help after running `autogram --help`, or `autogram-cli --help` on Windows.

### Styling

The application currently supports only one style - the state IDSK design. Additional styles are planned. However, styling already happens exclusively through cascading style sheets, see [idsk.css](https://github.com/slovensko-digital/autogram/blob/main/src/main/resources/digital/slovensko/autogram/ui/gui/idsk.css)

## Supported Cards

Currently, we support commonly used cards and their drivers:
- Any PKCS#11 compatible card (by setting a path to driver)
- Native support: Slovak ID card (eID client), I.CA SecureStore, MONET+ ProID+Q, Gemalto IDPrime 940

Adding more cards is relatively easy as long as they use PKCS#11.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- JDK 21 with JavaFX (see below)
- Maven
- Optional: Visual Studio Code as IDE or Intellij IDEA (community version is sufficient).

We recommend using Liberica JDK, which includes JavaFX, making everything simpler. After calling `./mvnw initialize`, it should download to `target/jdkCache`.

### Build

Running `./mvnw package` prepares everything in `./target`:

- `dependency-jars/`
- `preparedJDK/` - JLink JDK (JRE) prepared for bundling with the application.
- `autogram-*.jar` - JAR with the application

Then using `jpackage`, it creates all executable packages (.msi/.exe, .dmg/.pkg, and .rpm/.deb).

```sh
./mvnw versions:set -DnewVersion=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 | sed -r 's/^v//g')
./mvnw package
```

#### Debian/Ubuntu

```sh
sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk maven binutils rpm fakeroot
```

#### Fedora

```sh
sudo dnf install java-21-openjdk maven rpm-build
```

#### Linux Docker compose

There is a `docker-compose.yml` with 3 services to package 3 Linux distributables - `Ubuntu 22.04`, `Debian 11` and `Fedora 41`. Run:

```
docker compose up --build
```

And the resulting packages will appear in `packaging/output/`.
